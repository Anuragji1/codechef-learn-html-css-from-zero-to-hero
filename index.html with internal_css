Statement) Inline styles were a quick way of beautifying HTML, but they are rarely used by Web developers.
Can you think of any reasons?

If you want to style multiple elements (for example <section> or <h2> elements) which should have the same format - you will need to go and style each section or heading
Every time a new <section> or <h2> element is added - you will need to remember to add the same style element to it as well
Instead of the above, we can create the style element inside the <head> element of the HTML using the following syntax

<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
Task
In the previous problem, we used the following inline styling.

<h2 style='color: blue; font-size: 16px;'>
<ol style='color: blue; font-size: 16px;'>
Let us convert the same into an internal stylesheet using the syntax above.

Add styling for the <h2> and the <ol> elements to the <head>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOLUTION = <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>My recent trip to Greece</title>
  <style>
    h2 {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 16px;
    }

    ol {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My recent trip to Greece</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Overview</h2> <h3>
      <ol> <li>Greece</li>
        <li>Trip Options</li>
        <li>Trip Itinerary</li>
      </ol>
    </h3>

    </main>

  <footer>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Key changes:

Inline styles removed: The style attributes have been removed from the <h2> and <ol> elements.
Internal stylesheet added: The <style> element has been added within the <head> section to define styles for h2 and ol elements.
Consistent styling: Now, all h2 headings and ordered lists (ol) throughout the document will automatically have blue text and a font size of 16px.
Advantages of internal stylesheets:

Maintainability: Styles are defined in one place, making it easier to manage and update the overall look and feel of the website.
Consistency: Ensures consistent styling across multiple elements of the same type.
Organization: Keeps HTML and CSS code separate for better readability and structure.
