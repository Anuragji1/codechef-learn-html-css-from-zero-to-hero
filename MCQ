Statement) The following HTML code is trying to change the color of the heading, but fails to do so.
Can you debug this error?

<head>
  <style>
    <h1 style="color:blue;">Why am I incorrect?</h1>
  </style>
</head> 

Select one of the following options.
The syntax of the color property is incorrect - it should be colour.
The overall syntax is incorrect. It has been written in HTML instead of CSS inside the <style> element. The <h1> heading will not be displayed since it is inside the <head> block.
The opening and closing <style> tags are not required. Just the inline HTML syntax is sufficient.

SOLUTION = The correct answer is: The overall syntax is incorrect. It has been written in HTML instead of CSS inside the <style> element. The <h1> heading will not be displayed since it is inside the <head> block.
